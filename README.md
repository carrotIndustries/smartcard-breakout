Smart card breakout
===================

Breakout board for tapping off the signals of a smart card. I needed 
this for a future project and making my own was cheaper than buying 
one.

As usual, this board is made with [Horizon EDA](https://horizon-eda.org/).

surface. "Smart card breakout" is written on it.
On the left side, there are the usual eight smart card contacts. On the 
right side, the board widens and is populated with a black smart card 
socket.](photo.jpg?raw=true)

# Cover

To insulate the through-hole pins from the smart card connector and pin 
header, a 3D-printed cover can be attached to the mounting posts of the 
smart card connector:

The cover was designed in [Dune 3D](https://dune3d.org/).
